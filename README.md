# Workout-Tracker


This is workout tracker built using nodeJS, mongoDB, and express. The front-end for this assignment was provided by BCS.

The app allows users to add new resistance or cardio exercises, and track reps/sets/weight/duration, and plots the information to the stats page to allow the user to view progress over time.
